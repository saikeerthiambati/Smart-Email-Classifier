AI Powered Smart Email Classifier for Enterprises

An AI-powered system designed to automatically clean, categorize, and analyze enterprise email datasets for intelligent spam detection, email categorization, and priority assignment using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.

📌 Project Overview

Enterprises receive thousands of emails daily related to customer complaints, service requests, feedback, and spam. Manual email triaging is time-consuming and inefficient, often leading to delayed responses and reduced customer satisfaction.

This project focuses on building an AI-powered Smart Email Classifier that automates email categorization and supports intelligent decision-making by leveraging NLP and machine learning models.

🎯 Project Objectives

Automate email classification into multiple categories

Reduce manual effort in email triaging

Improve response prioritization and efficiency

Prepare the foundation for enterprise-level deployment

✅ Milestone 1 — Data Collection & Preprocessing (Completed)

Objective: Prepare a clean and labeled dataset for machine learning.

Key Achievements

1. Cleaned raw email datasets
2. Removed noise (HTML tags, punctuation, stopwords)
3. Normalized text for NLP processing
4. Labeled emails with:
          Spam / Non-spam
          Email categories
5. Engineered useful features:
text_length
num_words
num_digits
has_url
6. Generated a unified ML-ready dataset

📌 Final Output File:

data/clean/final_dataset.csv

✅ Milestone 2 — Email Categorization Engine (Completed)

Objective: Develop and evaluate an NLP-based email classification system.

Implemented Features:
1. TF-IDF based text vectorization
2. Baseline machine learning models:
           Logistic Regression 
           Support Vector Machine (SVM)
           Naive Bayes (for comparison)
Model evaluation using:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
Confusion matrix visualization for performance analysis
Comparative analysis of classifiers

📌 Key Script:

src/baseline_models.py

🛠 Scripts Overview
                	
combine.py	-         Merges raw datasets into a single dataset

category.py	-         Cleans email text and assigns categories

final_dataset.py	-   Generates the final ML-ready dataset

priority.py	-         Assigns urgency levels to emails

spam_email.py	-       Initial spam classification logic

baseline_models.py	- Trains and evaluates ML classifiers

🚀 How to Run the Project
Step 1: Navigate to the source directory
cd src

Step 2: Generate the final dataset
python final_dataset.py

This will create:

data/clean/final_dataset.csv

Step 3: Run Milestone 2 classification models
python baseline_models.py


This will:

1.Train ML models
2.Display evaluation metrics
3.Visualize confusion matrices

📌 Future Enhancements

Urgency prediction model (High / Medium / Low)

Deep learning models (BERT / DistilBERT)

Real-time email classification API (FastAPI / Flask)

Interactive dashboard for enterprise users

Cloud deployment (AWS / Azure / GCP)

Phishing detection using URL and content analysis
