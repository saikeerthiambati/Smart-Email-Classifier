# AI Powered Smart Email Classifier for Enterprises

An AI-powered system designed to automatically clean, categorize, and analyze enterprise email datasets for intelligent spam detection, email categorization, and priority assignment using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Enterprises receive thousands of emails daily related to customer complaints, service requests, feedback, and spam. Manual email triaging is time-consuming and inefficient, often leading to delayed responses and reduced customer satisfaction.

This project focuses on building an AI-powered Smart Email Classifier that automates email categorization and supports intelligent decision-making using NLP and Machine Learning models.

```
## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Automate email classification into multiple categories  
- Reduce manual effort in email triaging  
- Improve response prioritization and efficiency  
- Prepare a foundation for enterprise-level deployment

## ✅ Milestone 1 — Data Collection & Preprocessing (Completed)

**Objective:** Prepare a clean and labeled dataset for machine learning.

### Key Achievements
- Cleaned raw email datasets  
- Removed noise (HTML tags, punctuation, stopwords)  
- Normalized text for NLP processing  
- Labeled emails with:
  - Spam / Non-spam  
  - Email categories  
- Engineered features:
  - `text_length`
  - `num_words`
  - `num_digits`
  - `has_url`
- Generated a unified ML-ready dataset  

📌 **Final Output File**
```
data/clean/final_dataset.csv
```

## ✅ Milestone 2 — Email Categorization Engine (Completed)

**Objective:** Develop and evaluate an NLP-based email classification system.

### Implemented Features
- TF-IDF based text vectorization  
- Baseline ML models:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
  - Naive Bayes  

### Model Evaluation
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-score  
- Confusion Matrix  

📌 **Key Script**
```
