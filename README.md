# 📧 AI Powered Smart Email Classifier for Enterprises

An AI-powered system that automatically classifies enterprise emails and detects urgency to improve response efficiency using NLP and Machine Learning.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Enterprises receive thousands of emails daily related to customer complaints, service requests, feedback, and spam.  
Manual email triaging is time-consuming and inefficient, often leading to delayed responses and reduced customer satisfaction.

This project automates:
- Email categorization
- Urgency detection
- Priority assignment

using **Machine Learning and NLP techniques**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Automate email classification into multiple categories  
- Reduce manual effort in email triaging  
- Improve response prioritization and efficiency  
- Prepare a foundation for enterprise-level deployment  

---

## 🧠 Features

- 📂 Email Categorization (Complaint, Request, Spam, etc.)
- ⚡ Urgency Detection (High / Medium / Low)
- 🚨 Priority Assignment
- 🖥️ Interactive UI using Streamlit
- 📊 Cleaned & processed datasets
- 🧪 Rule-based + ML-based models

## ✅ Milestone 1 — Data Collection & Preprocessing (Completed)

**Objective:** Prepare a clean and labeled dataset for machine learning.

### Key Achievements
- Cleaned raw email datasets  
- Removed noise (HTML tags, punctuation, stopwords)  
- Normalized text for NLP processing  
- Labeled emails with:
  - Spam / Non-spam  
  - Email categories  
- Engineered features:
  - `text_length`
  - `num_words`
  - `num_digits`
  - `has_url`
- Generated a unified ML-ready dataset  

📌 **Final Output File**
```
data/clean/final_dataset.csv
```

## ✅ Milestone 3 — Urgency Detection & Priority Classification (Completed)

**Objective:**
Identify time-sensitive emails and assign appropriate priority levels to enable faster response handling.

**Key Achievements**

- Designed a rule-based urgency detection system
- Created a curated list of urgency keywords (e.g., urgent, immediate, ASAP, critical)
- Implemented urgency scoring logic based on:
         - Keyword frequency
         - Keyword position in email text
- Classified emails into priority levels:
              - High
              - Medium
              - Low
- Integrated urgency detection with category and spam classification outputs

📌 Key Scripts
```
src/urgency_model.py

src/urgency_keywords.py

src/priority.py
```

## ✅ Milestone 4 — Application Integration, Deployment & Documentation (Completed)

**Objective:**
Build an interactive user interface, integrate all ML components, and deploy the system for real-world usage.

**Key Achievements**

- Integrated all modules (spam detection, categorization, urgency) into a single pipeline
- Developed a user-friendly Streamlit web application
**Implemented:**
 - Email text input interface
 - “Classify Email” action button
Real-time display of:
         - Spam status
         - Email category
         - Urgency level
- Successfully deployed the application on Streamlit Cloud
- Added complete project documentation and licensing
